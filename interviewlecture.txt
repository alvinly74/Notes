tell me what you've been working on lately?


tell me about a bug or engineering problem you faced and how you solved it.
  tell behavior, runs slow, does not reload properly.

  what was causing the behavior.

  how you fixed it.

tell me about one of your projects.

sympathize that we are not CS degrees
  we study the basics like recursion, made data structures, understood algorithms
  time and space complexity, I might not have all of the theory that CS people have
  but I have more practical knowledge.



design patterns, architecture, scaling!

scaling => scala
functional programing?
c
